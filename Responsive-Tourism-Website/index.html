Constructed in 1591, the landmark is a symbol of Hyderabad and officially incorporated in the emblem of Telangana.[3] The Charminar's long history includes the existence of a mosque on its top floor for more than 425 years. While both historically and religiously significant, it is also known for its popular and busy local markets surrounding the structure, and has become one of the most frequented tourist attractions in Hyderabad. Charminar is also a site of numerous festival celebrations, such as Eid-ul-adha and Eid al-Fitr,[4] as it is adjacent to the city's main mosque, the Makkah Masjid.
                    The Charminar is situated on the east bank of Musi River.[5] To the west lies the Laad Bazaar, and to the southwest lies the richly ornamented Makkah Masjid.[6] It is listed as an archaeological and architectural treasure on the official list of monuments prepared by the Archaeological Survey of India.[7] The English name is a translation and combination of the Urdu words chƒÅr and minar or meenar, translating to "Four Pillars"; the towers are ornate minarets attached and supported by four grand arches.[6]</p>

Following the death of Sultan Mahmood Shah, the Sultanate disintegrated and Sultan Quli, who had been appointed as the Governor of Hyderabad by the Bahmani Kings, fortified city and made it the capital of the Golconda Sultanate. Because of the vicinity of diamond mines, especially Kollur Mine, Golconda flourished as a trade centre of large diamonds known as Golconda Diamonds. Golconda fort is currently abandoned and in ruins. The complex was put by UNESCO on its "tentative list" to become a World Heritage Site in 2014, with others in the region, under the name Monuments and Forts of the Deccan Sultanate (despite there being a number of different sultanates).[1] </p>

                    <p class="third-para">Hyderabad is the capital of the state of Telangana (separated from Andhra Pradesh on 2 June 2014). Between 1983 and 1989, N. T. Rama Rao served as the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh. During his tenure, he spent large sums to erect several statues of people from the region's political and religious history. During his visit to New York, he saw the Statue of Liberty and was inspired by the efforts to restore it. He said "I wanted something like that great place to visit... That would have been my contribution to society."[1]

                        Rama Rao chose to depict Gautama Buddha because "he was a humanitarian who told the whole truth to the people. It is our pride."[1] After a long search, he found a solid white granite rock near Raigiri, Bhuvanagiri (Yadadri Bhuvanagiri district) on a mountainside 46 km outside Hyderabad. In October 1985 NTR inaugurated work on structure. For over a year, hundreds of labourers helped the temple architect and builder S.M.Ganapathi Sthapati create the statue. After five years and the expenditure of US$3 million,[1] the statue stood at 58 feet (18 m) and weighed 350 tons, making it the world's tallest monolithic statue of the Buddha.[2] A concrete platform measuring 15 feet (4.6 m), now referred to as the "Rock of Gibraltar,"[3] was constructed in the middle of Hussain Sagar to aid in erecting the statue. The roads of the city were also widened for this purpose.[1] <br> This statue is located at Lumbini Park in the Hussain Sagar Island can be reached by boat in 15 minutes.[4] The statue is near to Lakdi-Ka-Pul, Khairatabad and Assembly Hyderabad metro stations. </p>

                    <p class="third-para">A gigantic 200 tonnes of artificial snow was laid on the layered flooring which was specially prepared to avoid seepage or melting. Every day, the top layer of snow is cleaned and an additional two to three tonnes of snow, which is generated within the facility, is used to top the snow spread. The artificial snow is made using a patented technology from Australia. The snow is made from water that is filtered four times so it won't harm children if they consume it, as they are prone to in other such locations.[4]<br>The park can accommodate a total of 2,400 visitors in a day. Every visitor gets acclimatised to lower temperatures in a step-wise manner, 20 ¬∞C (68 ¬∞F), then 0 ¬∞C, and then a sub zero temperature. This method is approved internationally.[4] In addition, visitors are given protective clothing like extra-warm sweaters and jackets and snow caps and a steaming cup of soupy broth for consumption to help them acclimatise to the rapidly but gradual temperature change.[6] The internal area, also called as the Cryo Zone,[5] maintains a constant temperature of ‚Äì 5 ¬∞C. For 1 hour, a maximum of 300 visitors at a time can explore the different facilities such as kids snow play area, snow wars, snow tube slide, sleigh slide, ice-bumping cars, merry-go-round and an ice skating rink.[4]</p>

The middle part is occupied by the main building and the kitchen, Gol Bangla, Zenana Mehal, and harem quarters stretch to the south. The Nawab was an avid traveller, and his influences show in the architecture, which combines Italian and Tudor influences.<br>The Palace has a library with a carved walnut roof, a replica of the one at Windsor Castle. The library had one of the finest collection of the Quran in India. The ground floor of the Palace housed the living quarters. A marble staircase leads to the upper floor. It has carved balustrades, which support marble figurines with candelabra at intervals.</p>
